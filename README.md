# PDGS
Protocol Dissector Generator System is a system created as a senior project to create dissectors for custom or non-IP protocols graphically and be able to export them in LUA format into Wireshark or TShark.

"Army Research Lab (ARL) Center for Cyber Analysis and Assessment recognizes the lack of dissectors for custom or non-IP protocols.  Developing custom dissectors are difficult and time consuming especially when the associated protocol specifications are not available. Analysts would have to infer the protocol specification through extensive trial and error. ARL wants a system that would allow analysts to create custom dissectors through a graphical workspace.   
The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and ARL are collaborating to develop a Protocol Dissector Generator System (PDGS) that will provide the following services: Creation of protocol structure graphically and Generation of a LUA dissector script."
